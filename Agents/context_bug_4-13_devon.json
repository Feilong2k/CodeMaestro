  "phase": "debug",
  "branch": "bugfix/4-13-mermaid-loading",
  "worktree_path": "../CM-devon",
  "requirements": [
    "Investigate `frontend/src/components/MermaidGraph.vue`.",
    "Implement a timeout (e.g., 2 seconds) for the `mermaid.render` call to prevent infinite spinning.",
    "Ensure `loading.value` is ALWAYS set to false, even if errors occur.",
    "Log the generated `diagramCode` to the console for debugging visibility.",
    "Add a fallback: if rendering fails, display the raw mermaid code in a `<pre>` block so the user can still see the logic.",
    "Verify `mermaid.initialize` configuration is compatible with version 11.x."
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Do not downgrade mermaid version.",
    "Maintain the existing styling/theme integration."
