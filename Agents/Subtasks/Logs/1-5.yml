notes:
  - "Tester has created failing unit tests for StatusBar component (Red). Tests are in src/__tests__/components/StatusBar.spec.js."
  - "DEVELOPER IMPLEMENTATION: StatusBar.vue created with fixed bottom bar, traffic light indicator (green active, yellow/red dimmed), current state text 'System Idle', and matrix theme styling. All 6 unit tests pass (Green)."
  - "REFACTOR: Extracted TrafficLight component, improved configurability with status prop, cleaned up code."
  - "TESTER: Created integration tests for StatusBar in src/__tests__/integration/StatusBar.integration.spec.js (Red)."
  - "INTEGRATION TESTS EXECUTED: All 6 integration tests fail as expected (Red) because StatusBar is not yet integrated into App.vue. This is the correct TDD Red phase."
  - "INTEGRATION TESTS GREEN: After integrating StatusBar into App.vue (right slot) and fixing TrafficLight class binding, all 6 integration tests pass (Green)."
