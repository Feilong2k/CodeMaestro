notes:
  - "Tester has created failing unit tests for ActivityLog component (Red). Tests are in src/__tests__/components/ActivityLog.spec.js."
  - "DEVELOPER IMPLEMENTATION: ActivityLog.vue created with list view, mock rows for Orion (Planning), Tara (Pending), and Devon (Coding). All 6 unit tests pass (Green)."
  - "REFACTOR: Extracted ActivityRow component, added computed status classes, improved maintainability."
  - "TESTER: Created integration tests for ActivityLog in src/__tests__/integration/ActivityLog.integration.spec.js (Red)."
  - "INTEGRATION TESTS EXECUTED: All 6 integration tests fail as expected (Red) because ActivityLog is not yet integrated into App.vue. This is the correct TDD Red phase."
  - "INTEGRATION TESTS GREEN: After integrating ActivityLog into App.vue (left slot), all 6 integration tests pass (Green)."
