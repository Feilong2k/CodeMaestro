notes:
  - "Tester has created failing unit tests for ActivityLog component (Red). Tests are in src/__tests__/components/ActivityLog.spec.js."
  - "DEVELOPER IMPLEMENTATION: ActivityLog.vue created with list view, mock rows for Orion (Planning), Tara (Pending), and Devon (Coding). All 6 unit tests pass (Green)."
  - "REFACTOR: Extracted ActivityRow component, added computed status classes, improved maintainability."
  - "TESTER: Created integration tests for ActivityLog in src/__tests__/integration/ActivityLog.integration.spec.js (Red)."
  - "INTEGRATION TESTS EXECUTED: All 6 integration tests fail as expected (Red) because ActivityLog is not yet integrated into App.vue. This is the correct TDD Red phase."
  - "INTEGRATION TESTS GREEN: After integrating ActivityLog into App.vue (left slot), all 6 integration tests pass (Green)."
  - "UI REFINEMENT REQUEST (from Orion): 1) Move Activity Log to RIGHT side of Chat panel (swap slots in App.vue). 2) Make Chat panel narrower, Activity Log wider (adjust grid cols in MainLayout.vue — text is squashed). 3) Extend Chat panel all the way down to touch the Status Bar (no gap). [DEFERRED: Resizable panels — future enhancement]"
  - "UI REFINEMENT IMPLEMENTED: ActivityLog moved to right slot (App.vue), grid columns adjusted (MainLayout.vue: left slot lg:col-span-2, main lg:col-span-5, right lg:col-span-5), Chat panel extended to bottom (pb-0, flex-col, flex-1). All integration tests pass (Green)."
