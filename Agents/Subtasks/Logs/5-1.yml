implementation_plan:
  - component: "ToolRegistry"
    path: "backend/src/tools/registry.js"
    details: |
      - Exports `getToolsForRole(role)` function.
      - Maps roles (Devon, Tara, Orion) to allowed tool definitions.
      - Tool definition includes `name`, `description`, `parameters`, `handler`.

  - component: "FileSystemTool"
    path: "backend/src/tools/FileSystemTool.js"
    details: |
      - `safeRead(path)`: Checks if path is within project root.
      - `safeWrite(path, content)`: Checks path, ensures directory exists.
      - `safeList(path)`: Lists directory contents.
      - Usage of `path.resolve` and `process.cwd()` for safety.

  - component: "GitTool"
    path: "backend/src/tools/GitTool.js"
    details: |
      - Wraps `simple-git` or controlled `child_process.exec`.
      - Methods: `status()`, `add(files)`, `commit(message)`, `push()`, `checkout(branch)`.
      - Enforces whitelist of args (e.g., no `; rm -rf`).

  - component: "DatabaseTool"
    path: "backend/src/tools/DatabaseTool.js"
    details: |
      - **Restricted to Orion.**
      - `savePattern(pattern)`: Inserts into patterns table.
      - `updateWorkflow(name, definition)`: Updates workflow engine.
      - `searchLogs(query)`: Searches structured logs.
