# ==========================================
# DEVON INSTRUCTIONS
# ==========================================
# Implement `backend/src/services/memoryService.js` to pass `backend/src/__tests__/unit/memoryService.test.js`.
# Use `pool` from `../db/connection`.
# If `pgvector` is not available, implement `searchContext` using simple text search (`ILIKE`) for now.
