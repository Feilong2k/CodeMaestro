      - grantOneTimeAccess(agentId, command, reason): Creates UUID token, stores in memory
      - validateGrant(agentId, command, token): Checks token validity, invalidates after use
      - Token expires after 5 minutes OR single use

    details: |
      - On non-whitelisted command failure, check for override token
      - If valid token, execute command
      - Log all override usages for audit
