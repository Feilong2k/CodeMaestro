  - "DEVELOPER IMPLEMENTATION: ChatPanel.vue created with message list, mock welcome message from Orion, editable input area, send button, and matrix theme styling. All 6 unit tests pass (Green)."
  - "TESTER: Created integration tests for ChatPanel in src/__tests__/integration/ChatPanel.integration.spec.js (Red)."
  - "INTEGRATION TESTS EXECUTED: All 5 integration tests fail as expected (Red) because ChatPanel is not yet integrated into App.vue. This is the correct TDD Red phase."
  - "INTEGRATION TESTS GREEN: After integrating ChatPanel into App.vue, all 5 integration tests pass (Green)."
  - "COVERAGE: Ran coverage for ChatPanel component: 50% statements, 0% branch, 0% functions, 55.55% lines. Below 80% target."
