relatedSubtask: "1-4"

description: |
  Allow users to drag and resize the width of the Chat panel and Activity Log panel.
  Currently the widths are fixed in the grid layout.

userStory: |
  As a user, I want to resize the Chat and Activity panels so I can allocate more 
  screen space to whichever panel I'm actively using.

acceptanceCriteria:
  - "[ ] Drag handle visible between Chat and Activity panels"
  - "[ ] Dragging the handle resizes both panels proportionally"
  - "[ ] Minimum width enforced (panels can't collapse to zero)"
  - "[ ] Resize state persists across page refresh (localStorage)"
  - "[ ] Works on desktop; hidden/disabled on mobile"

suggestedImplementation: |
  Options:
  1. Use a library like `splitpanes` (Vue-compatible)
  2. Custom drag handle with mouse events + CSS resize
  3. CSS `resize` property (limited browser support)
  
  Recommended: `splitpanes` for reliability and touch support.

affectedFiles:
  - "frontend/src/components/MainLayout.vue"
  - "frontend/src/App.vue"

dependencies:
  - "1-4 (Activity Log Shell) - completed"

notes:
  - "Deferred from 1-4 to focus on Phase 2 backend work."
  - "Can be picked up as a polish item after Phase 2."
