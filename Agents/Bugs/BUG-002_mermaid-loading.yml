title: "Workflow Visualization Infinite Loading (Mermaid)"
status: open
priority: high
reported: 2025-12-07
reporter: user
relatedSubtask: "4-13"

description: |
  When clicking the "Visualization" toggle in the Workflow Viewer, the Mermaid diagram fails to render and remains in a "Loading diagram..." state with a spinning indicator.
  
  The user reported: "hmm Visualization is not working from 4-13, it's just spinning"

affectedFiles:
  - "frontend/src/components/MermaidGraph.vue"
  - "frontend/src/components/WorkflowViewer.vue"
  - "frontend/src/utils/mermaidGenerator.js"

expectedBehavior: |
  The Mermaid diagram should render the workflow states and transitions shortly after the "Visualization" toggle is clicked.

actualBehavior: |
  The loading spinner persists indefinitely.

possibleCauses:
  - Mermaid library initialization issue (async/await timing).
  - Error in `generateMermaid` causing a silent failure or promise rejection not caught properly.
  - The `mermaidContainer` ref might be null when `renderDiagram` is called.
  - Mermaid `render` function might be throwing an error that isn't displaying in the UI properly (though error handling exists).
  - Version mismatch or missing dependency in `package.json` (though we added it).

notes:
  - "Must be fixed before Phase 5 starts."
