title: "Chat Panel Not Stretching to Bottom"

description: |
  The chat panel should stretch from just below the header to just above the status bar.
  Devon attempted to fix this with the following metrics:
  - Header: 3.5rem (approx 56px)
  - StatusBar: 2.5rem (approx 40px)
  - Chat panel height: 100vh - 6rem (fills remaining viewport)
  
  However, the chat panel still doesn't visually extend all the way to the status bar.
  There may be a gap or the calculation isn't being applied correctly.

affectedFiles:
  - "frontend/src/components/ChatPanel.vue"
  - "frontend/src/components/MainLayout.vue"
  - "frontend/src/App.vue"

expectedBehavior: |
  Chat panel should fill the vertical space between Header and StatusBar with no gap.
  The input area should be permanently visible at the bottom, just above the status bar.

actualBehavior: |
  There appears to be a gap or the chat panel doesn't reach the status bar.

suggestedFix: |
  - Check if MainLayout has padding/margin affecting the height
  - Verify the calc(100vh - 6rem) is applied to the correct element
  - Check if flexbox or grid is overriding the height
  - Inspect with DevTools to see actual computed height

notes:
  - "Deferred to focus on Phase 2 backend work."
  - "Low priority - cosmetic issue, doesn't affect functionality."
