Orion Quick Commands (paste these into chat)

Basic docs actions:
- list docs
- list docs/AfterPhase5
- search docs for Phase6
- read Docs/Phase6_Plan.md

Git actions:
- git status
- which branch

Notes:
- These work without an AI key (local router).
- Synthetic chat states are off by default; System Log will be cleaner.
- Queued runs (not chat) write to DB; to verify:
  node scripts/run-agent-executor-once.js
